%Neglect the time it takes for projectile or energy to travel to target

% time accounting for weapon misses/error
% 
%% timing
% if projectile hits its target, the target will no longer be focused and
% the target will fall for a time
    %if projectile misses, fire again instantaneously

% DEWs time to kill with high power microwaves or lasers (AOE vs Pinpoint
% accuracy)(Fry circuits vs melt through)
    % how long does energy need to be focused on target to neutralize?
        % Laser: 10-60 seconds depending on how far away, how strong laser
        % is, and how strong material is
        %Microwaves: 1-10 seconds to fry circuits, depending on the same.
    % range of weapons and how much Area of Effect
    % if DEW runs out of power (especially for mobile effector), then it is
    % disabled until further notice
            % charge up time?
    %continuous energy output until target is neutralized

%% kill

% if projectile location = target location, then target is killed
    % when target is killed, remove target from simulation
